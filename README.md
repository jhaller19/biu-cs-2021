## Projects
### BRE:IN Enhancements
A number of new features and improvements were implemented in the BRE:IN tool. These changes are reflected in the "BREIN_nuSmv_version" directory. Changes include:
- Broader support for regulation condition input syntax, i.e. the combination of comma-separated function numbers and '..' separated ranges
- Capability to define uniqueness of solutions by regulatory conditions used (as opposed to concrete interactions)
- Support for showing the user which regulatory conditions were used in each solution, with the option to export solutions to the BooleSim simulator or a R BoolNet network object
### Programs Built On Top of BRE:IN
We built 2 programs as abstractions on top of BRE:IN
- Pertubation Predictor
- Minimal-Contradictory-Core Identifier
### Inter-tool Conversions
